# Sticker Stories
## repository of public service digital sticker artwork (and stories)


This is the HQ for the upcoming Kickstarter - **Sticker Stories**. The goal is to create a repository of stickers from across the 'public service internet'. This will hopefully include artwork, attribution information and any stories behind the stickers (or acknowledgement of a willingness for me to contact someone to learn the stories :)

Eventually it will be a book. Once all this COVID-19 stuff subsides!

So here is what I am looking for....artwork for the stickers. Vector files would be perfect. Original JPEGs, PNGs, PDFs are still fine. All art submitted should include a .txt file that includes as many of these details as possible:

- Designer(s):
- Organisation:
- Team:
- Year:
- Licence: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/
- Willingness to be contacted: Y/N

- Behind the sticker story:
